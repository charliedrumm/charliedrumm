### [RouteFinder](https://github.com/charliedrumm/RouteFinder)
This project focuses on optimizing driving routes from University College Dublin (UCD) to Westmeath during rush hour traffic by leveraging less traditional routes and real-time traffic data. It uses a graph data structure to model the road network and Dijkstra's algorithm to find the quickest path, dynamically adjusting for current traffic conditions. The aim is to provide a more efficient and accurate navigation solution for daily commuters.
