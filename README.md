## Projects

### [Carbon Crusade]((https://github.com/charliedrumm/carbonGame))
Carbon Crusade is an educational game developed in Java using JavaFX aimed at encouraging kids to understand the benefits of using public transport. Through gamification, players learn to balance time, carbon, and money budgets while collecting gems placed at random locations around the map.

### [RouteFinder](https://github.com/charliedrumm/RouteFinder)
This project focuses on optimizing driving routes from University College Dublin (UCD) to Westmeath during rush hour traffic by leveraging less traditional routes and real-time traffic data. It uses a graph data structure to model the road network and Dijkstra's algorithm to find the quickest path, dynamically adjusting for current traffic conditions. The aim is to provide a more efficient and accurate navigation solution for daily commuters.
